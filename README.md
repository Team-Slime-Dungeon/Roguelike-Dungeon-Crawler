  This project was created using the Godot game engine. Originally, Godot 3.5.3 was used, but was later updated to the more recent version 4.2.1.

It also has support for C#, although this feature was not used for this project.
The sprites for this project were created using Aseprite, a tool for creating 2D pixel art sprites for games.
The music was created using LMMS, and the sound effects with Audacity.
