## Engine information
  This project was created using the Godot game engine. Originally, Godot 3.5.3 was used, but was later updated to the more recent version 4.2.1. Godot Is a node-based engine that supports builds for various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc). It allows for 2D and 3D game development using the GDScript language. It also has support for C#, although this feature was not used for this project.

The music was created using LMMS, and the sound effects with Audacity.
